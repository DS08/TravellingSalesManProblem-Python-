Here to find minimum shortest path having cost minimum can be found with the help of DIJkstras Algorithm.
Idea : Since it was given that cost between any two cities having direct connection, is always greater than 0
therefore we can think of Dijkstras Algorithm.

Moreover, the maximum cost can reach upto 200000 , therefore here infinite distance of city/vertex is greater than 200000.
So, here I took distance initially as 2000001 which is always assumed to be infinity.
